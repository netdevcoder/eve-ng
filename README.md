# eve-ng

This Repo code is my own personal code to automate creation of initial config for IOL running on eve-ng community edition.

HOW TO RUN : 
#autoconfig-IOL.py <PATH TO UNL FILE>
this code will parse the LAB file and then set initial config like device hostname, ssh , IP Address, and username/password/ 


Feel free to clone this code and modified it to your own needs.

thanks
